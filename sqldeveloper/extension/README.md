## Extensions
You can add new folders and nodes to navigators, new actions on objects (*or sets of them*), and new editors or viewers.

Depending on requirements, this can be done in either XML or java and deployed by simply copying an XML file to the appropriate directory, or creating an extension jar -- or *check for updates* bundle for XML and/or java.
